there is barely any documentation in the search.py file so just read this I guess
(this is where I wrote down the idea)
my terminology is ass since I barely know this shit

# This is a list of valid expressions for the search functions

## SET (these evaluate to the lowest level sql queries)

shourin chakraborty -> Just a name that searches via fts
23* -> matches the IDs
name matching: basic fts MATCH

id matching: this is little tricky as there needs to be an idno MATCH str that needs to change depending on the type of filter
|- year
|- branch
|- fd, hd, phd, mba

bhawan matching: basic LIKE search

GN, VK, etc
23*, 23B4*, 23B4A3, etc
Shourin Chakraborty

name -> not enclosed in anything
id -> enclosed in //: /B4A3/
bhawan -> enclosed in []: [GN]

/231053/ should also be a valid search query

id has a lot of variation within it

-> implementation
%23%
%23B4%
%23%1053
%B4%

there are always 2 '%'s in the LIKE string

the year and branch go to the right of 1% and left of 2% (branch after year)
id is the only thing that goes to the right of 2%

to simplify the regex the year can only be numerals wide,
no one's gonna be writing the whole year anyways

All of these evaluate to python sets

## & (INTERSECTION)

/23/ & [GN] -> Valid
[GN] & /23/ -> Valid
Shourin & /b4a7/ -> Valid
/b4a7/ & Shourin -> Valid

shourin & /b4/ & [GN] -> Valid

evaluation order - (shourin & /b4/) & [GN]  {left to right}

functools reduce the fuck out of this shit

unions and intersections are associative anyways

## | (UNION)

UNION of two low level queries
shourin | /b4/ | ([GN]|[KR])


since intersections distribute over unions

all set operations are basically unions of a bunch of intersections

the same way all mathematical statements are basically sums of products
the sums are called expressions and the products are called terms

therefore unions are the outermost statement in this grammar


## Brackets

this basically gives priority, so imagine a new branch starts growing immediately

'(' union ')'

([GN] | [KR]) & /b4/

# Some Example Strings

(shourin & GN) & b4

ram & /b4/ & [GN]|[KR]


# Crystallising all of this into a PEG in infix notation (idfk lmao read the wiki page)

```
query_set :: fts_name or id or bhawan
set :: query_set or '(' union ')'
intersection :: set ('&' set)*
union :: intersection ('|' intersection)*
```
where fts_name is a Word(alpha)

id is a /Word(alphanum)/ that matches "([0-9]{2}|)([a-zA-Z][0-9]|)([a-zA-Z][0-9]|)([0-9]{4}|)" -> this has 4 groups corresponding to each part of the id

bhawan is [Word(alpha)]
