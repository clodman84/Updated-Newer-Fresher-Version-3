Getting Started
===============


Konichiwa! Welcome to the **DoPy Billing App, also known as Updated-Newer-Fresher-Version-3**!
This may seem somewhat complicated, but it's much easier than it may feel like, so let's dive in!
(Also this app has been coded entirely by **clodman84**, and I haven't helped, so I'm gonna do my best here [I'm **DestinyBreacher** btw :D])

.. _Loading The Mess List:

Loading The Mess List
=====================

The mess list is a csv file which consists of the ID Numbers, Names, Genders and Hostels of all the students in the college. You can keep it anywhere on your
PC. To load the mess list, drag the :ref:`Logger` window away to reveal the toolbar located on the top of the main app window. Simply click on Tools -> Load Mess List.
Any csv file will appear green. Simply select it. Upon succesful loading, a message will pop up, and za roll will be loaded.


.. _Loading The Roll:

Loading The Roll
================

The roll is a folder containing all the images in one *DoPy Roll*. It will have a maximum of 40 images, and will have a suffix of *R*. Load the roll similarly
to the mess list (Tools->Load Roll). Choose the roll, and just click ok.


.. _Billing Window:

Using this window, you can search for names, IDs, hostels, etc. and bill them accordingly. clodman84 is so goated he made a parser to do shit lmaoooo.
