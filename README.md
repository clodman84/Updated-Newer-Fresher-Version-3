The dopy billing software is used by the Department of Photography BITS Pilani to associate images and room numbers with ids so that images can be billed and sent to students across the campus.
This application aims to overhaul the DoPy billing application and is a continuation of decades of evolution of our processes. Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://updated-newer-fresher-version-3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (the documentation is a work in progress as of writing this).
